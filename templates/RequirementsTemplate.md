# Notes


We assumed that:
- The manager is the only one who interacts with the LaTazza application.
- Clients refer manager in order to required new bevarages.
- The warehouse receives order requests by email, so he doesn't interact with the application.

# Stories and personas

**PERSONA1** : THE MANAGER

John Martin
42, manager of a company, divorced

As a manager, John is responsible for managing the sale of bevarages in the company
and for the payments of the capsules.
Currently when employees or visitors want to purchase new capsules, the manager handles the orders. 
Moreover, when the employees want to charge their local account, John updates their balances. 

Goals:
- Manage the summary of capsules available
- Make easier the management of economic transactions with clients and warehouse


It's monday morning.
John arrives in the office and he opens the application. 
He notices that the number of capsules available is not enough for the entire week. 
For this reason he decides to make an order to the warehouse.
The first client of the day is Greg, an employee, that he wants to order 25 capsules of different types. 
Since his local account is empty, he asks to John to charge his account.
So John selects the capsules requested and makes the order.
In this particular day, there are also a lot of visitors interested in the conference held in the company. 
One of them goes to John's office asking for a capsule of coffee.
John manages the order using the application and the visitor pays cash.
