# Notes
We assumed that:
- The manager is the only one who interacts with the LaTazza application.
- Clients refer manager in order to required new bevarages.
- The warehouse receives order requests by email, so he doesn't interact with the application.

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>  \<stories will be formalized later as use cases>

Persona1 : THE MANAGER

John Martin
42, manager of a company, divorced

As a manager, John is responsible for managing the sale of bevarages in the company
and for the payments of the capsules.
Currently when employees or visitors want to purchase new capsules, the manager handles the orders. 
Moreover, when the employees want to charge their local account, the John updates their balances. 

Goals:
- Manage the summary of capsules available
- Make easier the management of economic transactions with clients and warehouse


It's monday morning.
John arrives in the office and he opens the application. 
He notices that the number of capsules available is not enough for the entire week. 
For this reason he decides to make an order to the warehouse.
The first client of the day is Greg, an employee, that he wants to order 25 capsules of different types. 
Since his local account is empty, he asks to John to charge his account.
So John selects the capsules requested and makes the order.
In this particular day, there are also a lot of visitors interested in the conference held in the company. 
One of them goes to John's office asking for a capsule of coffee.
John manages the order using the application and the visitor pays cash.

actor manager as m
actor "Banking System" as bs

## Use Cases
\<describe here each use case in the UCD>

### Use case 1, Make an order
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There are not enough capsules|  
|  Post condition     | Now there are enough capsules|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The manager selects the number of boxes needed, sends an order to the warehouse. The application updates the summary after receiving the boxes  |
|  Variants     | If the delivered order is incorrect, the corresponding value will be refund to the manager. If the payment is unsuccessful, order will be cancelled. |

### Use case 2, Sell capsules
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Client asks for capsules|  
|  Post condition     | Client has got capsules to use|
|  Nominal Scenario     | If the client is an employee, the manager selects the corresponding local account, he selects the payment method, the number of capsules requested. Then he commits the request. The application updates the summary.  |
|  Variants     | If the capsules in the summary are not enough, the application prints an error message. If the debt is higher than threshold, sale will not be performed. |

### Use case 3, Add credit to local account's wallet
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Employees ask for adding credit to their account|  
|  Post condition     | The wallet balance is increased |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Manager takes money from an employee and then add credit to the wallet of the account related to that employee.  |
|  Variants     | The balance can be increased or decreased by a different amount than desired, due to typos. The increased wallet balance can belong to the wrong account. Possibility to undo should be implemented. |
